# MongoDB Dal Examples

This project contains simple examples of how to build database access access layers in several languages.

### Javascript: Getting Started

The Javascript example is written using ES6 classes and native promises.

To install dependencies with npm, naviate to the js-es6 directory and run
```
npm install
```
To run the Jasmine tests run
```
npm test
```
The tests are only simple unit tests designed to prove the functions work and to guide developers when attempting ot make changes to the example.
